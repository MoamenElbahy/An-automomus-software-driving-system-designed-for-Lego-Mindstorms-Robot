# Automomus-software-system-for-Lego-Mindstorms-Robot
An autonomous  software system designed for Lego Mindstorms Robot to solve a certain maze in a specified time using JAVA, To solve the maze the robot has to detect a required color which will be selected by the user at the beginning. The designed code mainly depended on O.O.P object oriented programing.

This was a part of practical caurse work as a team with my colleague [@sallamkhaled]( https://github.com/sallamkhaled?fbclid=IwAR1gxYeSiwcJVSaG1WBGklMRYzdNNklMlCGHIxGjGdsgc3fndWO5EIABv80 )
